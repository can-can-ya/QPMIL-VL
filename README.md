**Abstract**: Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification has very significant applications in clinical pathology, *e.g.*, tumor identification and cancer diagnosis. Currently, most research attention is focused on Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) using static datasets. One of the most obvious weaknesses of these methods is that they cannot efficiently preserve and utilize previously learned knowledge. With any new data arriving, classification models are required to be re-trained on both previous and current new data. To overcome this shortcoming and break through traditional vision modality, this paper proposes the first *Vision-Language*-based framework with *Queryable Prototype Multiple Instance Learning* (QPMIL-VL) specially designed for incremental WSI classification. This framework mainly consists of two information processing branches. One is for generating the bag-level feature by prototype-guided aggregating on the instance features. While the other is for enhancing the class feature through class ensemble, tunable vector and class similarity loss. The experiments on four TCGA datasets demonstrate that our QPMIL-VL framework is effective for incremental WSI classification and often significantly outperforms other compared methods, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

### üìö Recent Updates

- **12/10/2024**: Code & [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10573) are live.

*On updating. Stay tuned.*

## üë©‚Äçüíª Running the Code

### 1. CONCH Pre-trained Weight

First of all, you could download the pre-trained weight of pathology VLM CONCH [here](https://huggingface.co/MahmoodLab/CONCH/tree/main).

### 2. WSI Preprocessing

We use [CLAM](https://github.com/mahmoodlab/CLAM) to crop non-overlapping `256 √ó 256` patches from the segmented tissue at `10√ó` magnification. Then, pre-trained image encoder in [CONCH](https://github.com/mahmoodlab/CONCH) is used to extract instance features. You could move to [Pipeline-Processing-TCGA-Slides-for-MIL](https://github.com/liupei101/Pipeline-Processing-TCGA-Slides-for-MIL) for a detailed tutorial.

**Of course, you could also use the [dataset](https://pan.baidu.com/s/15ZxpXI2zqVuBb7gsqv_DTA?pwd=gd30) we prepared directly.**

### 3. Running Environment

All experiments are run on a machine with

- two NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPUs
- python==3.8 and pytorch==1.11.0+cu113

Detailed package requirements:

- for `pip` or `conda` users, full requirements are provided in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/can-can-ya/QPMIL-VL/blob/main/requirements.txt).
- for `docker` users, you could use our base docker image via `docker pull yuukilp/deepath:py38-torch1.11.0-cuda11.3-cudnn8-devel` and then install additional essential python packages (see [requirements.txt](https://github.com/can-can-ya/QPMIL-VL/blob/main/requirements.txt)) in the container.

### 4. Training Models

All important arguments are explained in `configs/main.yaml`. **You could replace the values of `dataset_root_dir` and `conch_ckpt_path` with <u>the root directory of dataset</u> and <u>the path of CONCH pre-trained weight</u> respectively.**

Finally, in the project directory `scripts/`, execute the following command (*ten-fold cross-validation*):

```bash
./main.sh
```
